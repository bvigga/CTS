SASS Development
------------------------

This project utilises the SASS CSS preprocessor. In order to edit locally, you'll need to install
a few packages::

    npm install
    gem install sass

To automatically compile your latest SCSS changes to CSS, we'll use grunt. To install grunt::

    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli

In a separate terminal run::

    grunt watch
