Maps
======================

CTS provides maps to visualize where Shipments and Packages have been scanned.


Shipments Map
------------------------

The Shipments Map is accessible from the Shipment listing page. Click the **Map View** button
to navigate to the map. The map initially loads with no data.
A user can filter available map data by *Donor*, *Partner*, or specific *Shipment*.

* **Donor** -- View shipments associated with the selected donor
* **Partner** -- View shipments associated with the selected partner
* **Shipment** -- View the selected shipment
* **reset** -- Resets all selected filters


Package Map
--------------

If a Shipment has shipped, maps of individual package scans are accessible when viewing
the detail page of a shipment.

#. From the shipment listing, select a shipment that has shipped
#. Click the globe icon for a package

This will render the location scans for this particular package along with related
metadata.
