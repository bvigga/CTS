The `International Rescue Committee (IRC)`_ built a remote verification and
monitoring system in order to track and report on the movement of goods to
ensure that the intended beneficiaries receive them. Due to staffing and lack
of access in some of the places we work, the monitoring system makes use of
creative remote monitoring methods (such as mobile data collection, QR coding
and GPS mapping) that integrates with a web application for administration,
management and reporting on the status of shipments. This system is known as
the **Commodity Tracking System (CTS)**.

Please see CTS's user and developer `documentation`_ for more information.
